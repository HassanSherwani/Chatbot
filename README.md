# Chatbot
Chatbot using neural network

# Objective

Objective of this excercise is to design a bot that can answer students' query.Our motive is to test out language modeling techniques and basic nltk module. 

# Goals

- Data is in json file. A corpora is needed to be created out of json file. Cleaning will be done to remove any extra space, noisy pattern in dataset.
- Use standard feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers
- The goal of our network will be to look at a bag of words and give a class that they belong too (one of our tags from the JSON file)

# Dependencies

- Python 3: Coding Language of the bot
- nltk: module used for language processing 
- key libraries: pandas,numpy,random json,tensorflow,tflearn
